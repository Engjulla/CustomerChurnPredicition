C Hotel Cancellation Prediction Model
In this repository, you will find the predictive model I developed to address a pressing challenge in the C Hotel chain based in Portugal: high cancellation rates, which, in some establishments, reached up to 42%. This data science project was initiated to accurately forecast net demand, manage cancellations more effectively, and aim to decrease these rates to a more sustainable 20%.

The model I've built harnesses various variables like Average Daily Rate (ADR), booking channels, customer types, and deposit types, employing extensive historical booking data to identify patterns and make accurate predictions.
I designed this model to serve as a tool for generating actionable insights to prevent cancellations. By identifying bookings that are more likely to cancel, the model enables hotels to take proactive measures, such as offering personalized incentives or packages, to retain these customers.
In the course of developing this model, I experimented with various modeling approaches. After testing and evaluation, it was the Random Forest model that demonstrated superior performance and achieved the desired outcomes.
But the ambition of this model goes beyond cancellation prevention. It's designed to provide valuable insights into booking trends and customer behavior, aiding in shaping future strategies regarding pricing, room allocation, marketing approaches, and customer communication.By optimizing demand prediction and improving inventory management, I believe this model can streamline operations and potentially lead to cost savings in the long run.

I encourage you to explore this repository, delve into the workings of the model, and see how it can contribute to creating more efficient and customer-centric environments in the hospitality industry.
